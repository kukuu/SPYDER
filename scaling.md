# Scaling
First priority: Implement comprehensive **tariff calculation tests** + **database connection pooling** - these will deliver immediate stability gains while you plan larger architectural changes.

- ðŸ“Š **Key Performance Indicators**

  - API Response: < 200ms for tariff comparisons

  - Concurrent Users: Scale to 10,000+ simultaneous comparisons

  - Test Coverage: 80%+ on core tariff logic

  - Deployment: Zero-downtime deployments via blue/green

- Phase 1: Immediate Wins (2-4 weeks)

  - Extract tariff calculation engine to isolated microservice

  - Implement Circuit Breaker pattern for external API calls

  - Add structured logging with correlation IDs

- Phase 2: Medium-term (1-3 months)

  - Migrate to event-driven architecture (price update events)

  - Implement CQRS for read/write separation

  - Add feature flags for gradual rollout

- Phase 3: Strategic (3-6 months)

  - Decompose monolith into domain services:

  - tariff-service (calculations)

  - user-service (profiles/usage)

  - comparison-engine (matching logic)
