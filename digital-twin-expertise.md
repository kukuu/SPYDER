# Digital Twin Expertise

My career is defined by pioneering high-impact Digital Twin solutions within the IIoT sector, an expertise that has contributed to my recognition as one of the UK's Top 50 Influential Technologies. This accolade reflects my proven ability to architect systems that transform operational workflows, enhance efficiency, and enable predictive maintenance. A prime example is my work on the **StrikeNet** project for the UK Ministry of Defence, where I architected a defence-grade digital twin that created a virtual replica of physical combat systems. By integrating real-time IoT sensor data and AI-driven analytics to simulate scenarios and predict outcomes, this solution reduced operational risks by 30%, demonstrating the profound operational advantage this technology delivers in critical environments.

My approach to Digital Twin technology focuses on creating solutions that connect, aggregate, and analyze disparate data sources—from IoT sensors to building management systems. This provides building operators with a unified, intelligent view of their assets, enabling a shift from reactive maintenance to a predictive model. The result is the automation of repetitive monitoring tasks, optimized energy consumption, and preemptive identification of maintenance needs, all of which drive significant gains in both operational efficiency and sustainability.

Furthermore, I have successfully applied these core IIoT and Digital Twin principles https://github.com/kukuu/SPYDER/blob/main/README.md, to direct sustainability initiatives, such as the SPYDER Smart Energy Meter Reader - https://www.energytariffscheck.com/. This platform acts as a forecasting and settlement digital twin for the energy market, leveraging AI to analyze tariff data and empower consumer efficiency. By enabling smarter energy choices, it directly supports Net Zero carbon goals, demonstrating the versatile application of Digital Twin technology to not only enhance operational resilience but also to deliver measurable, widespread environmental impact.

My  experience and qualifications align directly with your requirements, including an MSc in Engineering and over 15 years of hands-on software development, with the last 4+ years specifically managing product engineering teams for platforms like the FIFA World Cup 2022 SaaS. I possess deep proficiency in AWS, Azure, and Agile/Scrum, and my leadership is defined by a passion for mentoring engineers and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. This is complemented by hands-on experience with REST APIs, C++, Docker, and a solid understanding of cloud security and compliance, as demonstrated in my work on secure, defence-grade projects for the MOD and GCHQ.
