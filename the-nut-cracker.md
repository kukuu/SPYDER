# The Nut Cracker  (V4 - Python)**

https://github.com/kukuu/digital-twin-PV4- (**PRIVATE** Python)

The primary objective of **Nut Cracker** (Digital Twin V4) is to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), to streamline the transaction process involving data generation, processing,and transformation - ETL. This process focuses on real-time data sourced from distributed and disparate networks and systems. It's ML lifecycle covers data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring.

- Key functionalities include:

1. Predictive Analysis: Utilizing AI to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies such as spikes, valleys, and boundaries, enabling predictive maintenance and detecting outliers or tampered data.

2. Visualization and Reporting: Generating comprehensive visualization reports, graphs, and documentation to review real-time system performance. These tools aid in forecasting and enhancing productivity by providing actionable insights, real-time monitoring, optimisation, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing decision-making.

Nut Cracker aims to integrate AI and ML  technologies to optimize data workflows, deliver predictive insights, and provide robust visualization tools for performance monitoring and future planning. As a high-volume throughput system, it exemplifies real-time asynchronous data processing capability ensuring scalability, reliability, flexibility, observability, security and addresses challenges like schema evolution and fault tolerance.

NodeJS, JavaScript,  Python, Machine Learning, Artificial Inrtelligence, Event Driven Concurrency, RDBMS / NoSQL technologies (e.g. MySQL, Redis, DynamoDB), and cloud technologies are core in this innovation.
