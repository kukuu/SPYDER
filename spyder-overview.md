# SPYDER

## Your Personalised Energy Tariff Service.


**SPYDER**, hosted on https://www.energytariffscheck.com/,  is an AI-driven platform for the energy sector. Owned and developed by _Alexander Adu-Sarkodie_, it was designed to ingest, process, and make sense of complex energy tariff data to provide actionable insights - a similar challenge to making sense of contract and generation data for policy compliance and reporting.

Its proven track record is honed in applying AI to core business problems. **SPYDER** uses Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models and Retrieve Augmentation Generators algorithms to interpret complex energy tariffs, automating a manual consultancy process and enabling customers to self-serve the best pricing, thereby solving a direct business and customer challenge.

A Net Zero initiative, **SPYDER** uses  AI-driven analytics and user-friendly tools to compare tariffs, track consumption, simulate scenarios, predict outcomes, enable forecasting, facilitate predictive maintenance, and recommend cost-effective renewable energy options by saving on energy bills. It integrates dynamic carbon footprint tracking, personalised energy-saving strategies, and compliance frameworks into a scalable platform - helping users align sustainability goals with practical, measurable actions.

The Reader mirrors the real-world entity by continuously collecting data from sensors, real-time data streams, data lakes, IIoT, IoT devices, and other sources. The data is then processed and analysed to create a digital replica that accurately reflects the behaviour, status, and condition of its physical counterpart. 

By leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics, **SPYDER** (a Digital Twin) can simulate various scenarios and predict future outcomes. This enables stakeholders to monitor performance, diagnose issues, optimise processes, and make data-driven decisions in real-time.

This project reflects my passion for using technology as a dual force for environmental and economic impact - turning complex energy decisions into clear, actionable steps for a sustainable future. It follows my work on the OFGEM MHHR initiative for the UK Energy Sector. The MHHR is a transformative energy sector initiative modernising the UK’s electricity settlement system to half-hourly intervals, enabling accurate billing, grid flexibility, and smarter energy use. It paves the way for renewable integration and cost savings for consumers.

**SPYDER**'s algorithm concept is also behind the modernisation of the UK MOD StrikeNet project, where, under my supervision and guidance as Technical Authority, it was used to architect a defence-grade digital twin that virtualised combat systems, integrating real-time analytics and AI to enhance mission readiness. The solution reduced operational risks by 30% while enhancing asset management and reliability, demonstrating its value in high-stakes environments where cost efficiency and system resilience are paramount.

**SPYDER** works alongside ''Ask JIM'' - A unique, custom domain-based Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, RAG and Large Language Model trusted Companion with all the information you need about energy savings, consumption and social impact.  ''Ask JIM’'  combines real-time meter data analysis with comprehensive energy market intelligence to deliver personalised, actionable insights that save you money while reducing your environmental footprint:
